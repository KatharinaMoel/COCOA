This repository contains datasets used in the research activities of the **Performance Engineering Laboratory** at the [School of Computer Science (University College Dublin)](http://www.csi.ucd.ie).

Datasets
----------------------
This repository contains a set of synthetic datasets that were generated with COCOA framework and which aim to broaden the scenarios for testing anonymization algorithms.

### 1. [Adult Datasets] (https://github.com/ucd-pel/COCOA/tree/master/adultCOCOA) ###

This dataset is based on the Adult census dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). It is composed of 9 socio-economic demographic attributes (e.g., occupation, education, and salary class).

### 2. [German Credit Datasets] (https://github.com/ucd-pel/COCOA/tree/master/germanCOCOA) ###

This dataset is based on the German Credit dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29). It is composed of 20 credit-related attributes (e.g., employment, purpose of credit, credit class). 

### 3. [Insurance Datasets](https://github.com/ucd-pel/COCOA/tree/master/insuranceCOCOA) ###

These datasets correspond to data containing records with social and demographic information from individuals. This information corresponds to attributes such as their age, occupation, workplace, favorite recreational activity and places where this is practiced. Moreover, this datasets contain two classification attributes (risk of accident and salary class).

### 4. [Irish Census Datasets] (https://github.com/ucd-pel/COCOA/tree/master/irishCensusCOCOA) ###

These datasets correspond to tabular data containing records with social, economic and demographic data which mimics the distribution of aggregated statistics from the 2011 Irish Census data. More details about the values of each attribute and methodology followed to generate this dataset can be found in the technical report available at: (https://www.csi.ucd.ie/content/synthetic-data-generation-using-benerator-tool)
